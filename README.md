I have understanding of the practices and processes used by a junior or associate data analyst in their day-to-day job. I have key analytical skills such as data cleaning, data analysis, & data visualization and I can manipulate data using spreadsheets, SQL, R programming, and visualize data using Tableau. I can visualize and present data findings in dashboards, presentations, and commonly used visualization platforms.
